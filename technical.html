          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
          <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>

         <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
         <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. </p>

        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore <code>(_)</code>, or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
With the keyword var. For example,
<code>var x = 42.</code>
</p>
<p>Several issues have to be considered during declaration</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the function.</li>
  <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
  <li>The name of the function.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
</ul>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

By simply assigning it a value. For example,
<code>x = 42.</code></p>

        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
The name of the function.
<code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
</p>
        <p>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets,<code> function square(number) { return number * number; }{ }</code>.</p>
